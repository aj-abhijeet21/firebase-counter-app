# counter_firebase

A simple counter app but with a little bit of twist!

Instead of updating the counter value locally inside the app, the value gets updated in real-time at the FireStore.

This project also features 3 different screens having their own Counters, which can be navigated by a BottomNavigationBar.

These 3 counters' values get updated at the FireStore in real-time, and also has a reset button which can reset all the counters at once.
